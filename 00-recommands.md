### Apache Spark
- **Memory management**

	- [APACHE SPARK : MEMORY MANAGEMENT AND GRACEFUL DEGRADATION](https://ogirardot.wordpress.com/2014/12/11/apache-spark-memory-management-and-graceful-degradation/)

	- [Project Tungsten: Bringing Spark Closer to Bare Metal](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/04/28/project-tungsten-bringing-spark-closer-to-bare-metal.html)  
		1. **Memory Management and Binary Processing:** leveraging application semantics to manage memory explicitly and eliminate the overhead of JVM object model and garbage collection.  
		2. **Cache-aware computation:** algorithms and data structures to exploit memory hierarchy.  
		3. **Code generation:** using code generation to exploit modern compilers and CPUs.
