Hi, I am Ambling Ding. Welcome to my blog.

I am now a Ph.D student at Zhejiang University, China. My research interests lie on
the broad area of distributed data management, especially on the data analysis techniques based on the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. I believe that the ability to handle *really* big data will definitely  enhances every aspect of human civilization and in the end improves daily life of everyone.

Besides the concentration on the backend techniques, I am actually trying to become a full-stack programmer. I have tried to build some reactive websites with HTML5, iOS and Android apps based on [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/), as well as desktop clients based on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/). Though not experienced, being able to do has been seen very useful in some circumstances.

I am going to maintain some useful links, information as well as some of my thoughts
that maybe useful to others on this site.
Hope you like it.
