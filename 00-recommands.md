		1. **Memory Management and Binary Processing:** leveraging application semantics to manage memory explicitly and eliminate the overhead of JVM object model and garbage collection.  
		2. **Cache-aware computation:** algorithms and data structures to exploit memory hierarchy.  
		3. **Code generation:** using code generation to exploit modern compilers and CPUs.
