In this post, I'd like to list the technical stack with some useful links for a *fresh new* [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) developer, who may have some fundamental programming skills while feeling lacking of a mass of background knowledge to be an efficient user or developer of Spark. I hope that the list can serve as index of the path to be a skilled Spark developer.

Without assumption of the reader's technical background, I will start with some *Basic Tools*.

## Basic Tools

## Linux
- env
- script

## Java
