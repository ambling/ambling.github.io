Hi, I am ambling. Welcome to my blog.

I am now a Ph.D student at Zhejiang University, China. My research interests lie on 
the area of distributed data management, and a full-stack programmer is my goal.

I am going to maintain some useful links, information as well as some of my thoughts 
that maybe useful to others on this site. 
Hope you like it.
