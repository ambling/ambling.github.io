In this post, I'd like to list the technical stack with some useful links for a *fresh* [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) developer, who may have some fundamental programming skills while feeling lacking of a mass of background knowledge as an efficient user or developer of Spark. I hope the list can serve as index of the path and facilitate potential developers to be skilled. Without assumption of the reader's technical background, I will start from *JAVA*.
